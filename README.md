# Darren Knuckles – Frontend Developer Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal frontend development portfolio. The purpose of this site is to showcase my technical skills, projects, and ability to build responsive, accessible, and visually clean user interfaces using modern web technologies.

The portfolio highlights my growing experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, along with my ability to structure projects using best practices in frontend development. Each project presented within the site demonstrates different aspects of web development including responsive design, user interface layout, interactive functionality, and maintainable code structure.

The website itself was built from scratch using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques, focusing on clarity, performance, and accessibility. It is designed to be fully responsive so that it works well across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Within the portfolio you will find sections that include:

• A personal introduction and professional summary  
• A technology stack highlighting the languages and tools I use  
• Featured projects with descriptions, technologies used, and repository links  
• Contact links for GitHub, LinkedIn, email, and resume  

This project is part of my ongoing journey into professional frontend development. As I continue to build new projects and expand my knowledge of modern frameworks and tools, this portfolio will evolve to reflect my growth as a developer.

Future improvements planned for this portfolio include additional projects, deeper JavaScript functionality, UI/UX improvements, and potential integration of modern frontend frameworks such as React.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work.
